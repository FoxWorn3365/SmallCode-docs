    <h1>Language: Methods</h1>
    <i>You can define a method: watch <a href='/docs/functions/make'>make</a></i>.<br><br>
    Unlike other programming languages ​​SmallCode offers methods instead of functions.
    They are practically the exact same thing but are handled differently by the SmallCode functions (those in the "Functions" section in the search bar) and often interact with each other.
    <h3>How to use a method</h3>
    If a method must return a value then it is convenient to use <a href='/docs/functions/get'>get</a>, otherwise it will be possible to use both <a href='/docs/functions/get'>get</a> and use the <a href='/docs/functions/method'>method</a> function.<br>
    <h3>Structure of methods</h3>
    The methods are structured in such a way as to present an easy and intuitive as well as set-based structure.<br><br>
    <code>[DOMAIN].[FUNCTION]([ARGS]) -> json.import(myJson)  => json -> DOMAIN & import -> FUNCTION</code>
    <h3>Methods args</h3>
    Args are defined on each page of this documentation for the method concerned and can support strings only, arrays only, or both.
